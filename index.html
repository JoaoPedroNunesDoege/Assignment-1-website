        <h2>Personal Info:</h2>
          <p>Hi my name is Joao Pedro Nunes Doege I'm also known as Pedro.
            I was born in Brazil and have been living in Australia for half of my life - I speak fluent Portuguese, English and a bit of Spanish. I completed year 12 in Brazil over 14 years ago. Since then I have studied a certificate IV of accounting at TAFE but have worked predominantly as a chef.
             My hobbies vary; from playing drums and guitar to riding a road bike, going to the gym, troubleshooting technology and going to the beach. I also have 3 children that keep me occupied 24/7.</p>
