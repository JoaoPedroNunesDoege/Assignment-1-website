    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>The fact that someone has created the internal workings of a computer through their knowledge of Information Technology fascinates me.  My interest in IT stems back to my first computer; a Pentium II , windows 98, 500 megabytes HD 32 megabytes ram,  I spent so much time playing with it and troubleshooting it even before the  internet. Once dial up Internet was introduced it fascinated me even more. I feel like I finally have a chance of studying something I have always been passionate about.</p>
      <p>I choose RMIT because it has a good reputation and offers the course full time online  which suits my family life perfectly as I can study at home in my own time and still have time to organize the children.</p>
      <p>I expect to further my overall knowledge of IT, to learn all that I can about the industry and then choose a path and a specific field where I can specialize and hopefully build a career in. </p>
